### Aggregation of marginal gains

In my recent read of Atomic Habits by James Clear, I came across this fascinating story of how British Cycling changed one day in 2003 with marginal improvements.

Professional cyclists in Great Britain used to endure 100 years of mediocrity. Since 1908, British riders had just won a single gold medal in the Olympic games and fared worst performance in cycling's biggest race Tour de France with no British cyclist winning an event.

In 2003 governing body for professional cycling in Great Britain hired Dave Brailsford as its performance director. And he made an exceptional trajectory in the career of British cyclists with marginal gains.

Brailsford and his coach began by making minor adjustments in the training and routine of the cycling team. They redesigned bike seats, improved tire grip, tested costume fabric, and worked on hundreds of other marginal improvements.

But they did not stop there. Brailsford and his team continued to find 1 percent improvements in overlooked and unexpected areas. They hired a surgeon to improve each cyclist's sleeping pattern and building better immunity.

The results came faster than imagined. Just five years after Brailsford took over, the British Cycling team dominated the road winning, 60 percent of gold medals in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Another bar set next year winning, 9 Olympic records in London.

Bradley Wiggins became the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France. And Next year, his teammate Chris Froome won the race, and he would go on to win again in 2015, 2016, and 2017.

Aggregation of marginal gains played a prominent role in making British Team one of the best cyclists in the world. This story of how small improvements accumulate in remarkable results.

We all acknowledge the prominence of aggregating good habits. But why is it still hard to grow on it and replicate this approach in our life? At least I have been struggling!
