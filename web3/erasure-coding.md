### Erasure Coding

The exponential growth in the volume of data is forcing developers to rethink their storage strategies. One challenge they face is finding a solution data protection and resiliency

Erasure coding (EC), which is becoming the preferred choice for data protection in large datacenters. Erasure codes have evolved from traditional Reed-Solomon algorithm to more sophisticated locally recoverable and regenerating codes that can perform more efficient data recovery. Erasure codes are compute-intensive and impose higher resource cost on distributed storage system solutions.
