### Understanding Economics across Networks

Crypto represents a new era of economic activity, driven by blockchain technology advancements that enable users to transition from web2 to web3. This shift is influenced by narratives like DeFi, meme trading, SocialFi, and RWAs, all underpinned by game theory.

Recent innovations in Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions, gasless transactions, and account abstraction have expanded the possibilities for blockchain applications. New Layer 1 (L1) and L2 networks regularly emerge, offering incentives for users and dApps, which in turn attract liquidity to these new chains. Understanding the flow of users and their economic activities across different chains, especially between L1 and L2, becomes crucial.

### The Why

Crypto is also the game of rotation and is still far away to be adopted as the primary foundation to consumer internet. To ensure its survival through Bull and Bear market, it becomes necessary for networks (chains) to identify the narratives leading the ecosystem and ensuring the 

Over last three yrs we have seen Fantom summer, Solana summer, Polygon summer, Arbitrum summer, and zkSync summer. All these periods have attributed the growth of such networks but the growth in users and value not necessarily last longer and result in many cases to be a very

We have also seen the major setbacks like FTX Collapse but it becomes necessary

Thus it becomes critical to dive int

By exploring bridge activity, and the evolution of TVL, gas fees, the number of users, transactions, and volume across chains, L1 proving and publishing costs, we will be able to find outliers and patterns and benefit to the .

### Parameters across Networks
* Liquidity bridged from Ethereum to Chains (Total, ETH, USDC, USDT)
* Volume (usd) on chains
* Number of users bridged to chains
* Number of users / timeframe on chain
* New token listing on chains
* Native token market cap
* Native token DEX volume (Uniswap V2, V3)
* New contracts on chains
* Number of transactions / timeframe on chain
* Gas used / timeframe on chain
* Avg gas fees / transaction
* Change in median gas price on chains
* Revenue generating 


##### Transaction Count
The number of transactions processed on a blockchain is a reliable metric for measuring its usage. However, it should be noted that this metric alone may not provide sufficient insight into the actual value of the transactions being conducted. For instance, while some chains may have a lower transaction count, the value of these transactions may be significantly higher due to their use in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. On the other hand, certain chains may have a higher transaction count due to their use in gaming or other applications involving lower value transactions.

#### Influence of cost in rollups

* Transacation Cost
* L1 Proving Cost
* L1 Data Publishing Cost


##### Transaction Cost
This is the amount that users pay per transaction. On EVM chains, transaction costs depend on the complexity of the transaction (which is measured in gas). A simple transaction, e.g. a native ETH transfer, uses less gas than a more complex transaction, e.g. an ERC20 swap. Hence, we calculated this metric by looking at the median transaction costs. IMX doesn't charge transaction costs.

##### L1 Proving Cost

##### L1 Data Publishing Cost


##### Onchain Profit
Onchain Profit is a key metric for assessing the financial viability of scaling solutions. It quantifies profitability by comparing the revenue generated from L2 gas fees collected to the costs associated with data & proof posting onto the Ethereum blockchain. L2 profitability can increases for two reasons: firstly, when there is high demand for L2 blockspace, enabling an auction of the available blockspace for a premium. Secondly, if the operator (who controls the sequencer) increases the base fee scalar. This metric can be used to gauge the health and success of Layer 2 solutions.
