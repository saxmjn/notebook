## Macha Federated Protocol

Macha is building a Federated Network for Social Layers with a mission to bring decentralized social content from **blockchains and P2P ecosystem**, and become a single discovery and distribution layer of new internet.

We're building an infrastructure that access social data from protocols and projects like Lens, Farcaster, Zora, Poap and ENS and many more. Built with its own data nodes network, Macha is developed to fetch, and index data from blockchains and abstract the data making it accessible and searchable to various applications through Macha Network.



### Problems in Distributed Social Layers

Accessing different social data of multiple protocols on any blockchain network is difficult due to its nature and data structure which is fragmented and scattered on different chains and P2P Networks. Published content either on-chain or off-chain using IPFS and Arweave becomes siloed to a particular environment and is not openly discoverable to many users on the network.

Hence even though the blockchain and P2P data are public, there are a lot of blockers before the public can access this data. So it needs re-engineering for the future of the internet.

And with further advancements in the layer2 scaling solutions and the modular architecture there are likely be an ecosystem of *app-chains*. Which means there will be more fragmentation and bad user experience in utilizing assets and performing actions across the ecosystems. 


### Architecture
Macha architecture is modular and it is sufficiently decentralised in nature with actions are store on chain while data is store in a distributed network of nodes.
