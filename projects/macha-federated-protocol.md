## Macha Federated Protocol

Macha is building a Federated Network for Social Layers with a mission to bring decentralized social content from **blockchains and P2P ecosystem**, and become a single discovery and distribution layer of new internet.

We're building an infrastructure that access social data from protocols and projects like Lens, Farcaster, Zora, Poap and ENS and many more. Built with its own data nodes network, Macha is developed to fetch, and index data from blockchains and abstract the data making it accessible and searchable to various applications through Macha Network.
